# Project 2: AR Book Cover

### Introduction

In this project, a review of the book, "Diary Of A Wimpy Kid", is given through the use of AR. In particular, the front of the book is scanned and the user is able to see a virtual scene created, inspired by the general theme of the book. The back of the book can be scanned and will the user can see some salient information about the book. The user can then press a virtual button to then toggle the text, displaying a review of the book. 

### How To Reproduce Project

First, please make sure that Unity and Unity Hub are installed. I am on Version 3.0.1 of Unity Hub, and I am using Unity Version 2017.3.0f1.

Execute the following steps to reproduce the project:

1. First, clone the repository via `git clone https://github.com/aadarshjha/arbookproject`, in any directory you would like. 
2. Then, open Unity Hub (I am using Version 3.0.1), and press the "Open" button under Projects. 
3. Locate the directory you have cloned, and press the "Open" button.
4. Unity will open the project. It may take a bit of time to open the project intially. 
5. Unity will open the project, but you may first encounter an "Untitled Scene". In the left lower pane, under the Assets folder, click on the "Scenes" folder. s
6. You should see a scene called "BookCover". Click on this scene.
7. The scene will then open up and you can interact with the project.
